    "An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud. I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words. This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again.I know words. I have the best words. This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE.Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes!"
